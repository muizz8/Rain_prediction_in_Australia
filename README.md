# üåßÔ∏è Rain Prediction in Australia üá¶üá∫

Welcome to the Rain Prediction in Australia project repository! In this project, we aim to predict whether it will rain in various regions of Australia using machine learning algorithms. We explore different techniques for data preprocessing and model evaluation using popular Python packages such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

## Overview

This repository contains:

- Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the implementation of:
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Data Preprocessing techniques specific to rain prediction
- Python scripts showcasing:
  - Data preprocessing steps using Pandas and NumPy tailored for rain prediction
  - Model training and evaluation using Scikit-learn
- Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze rainfall patterns and model performance

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the code.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts using your preferred Python environment.
